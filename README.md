# SAS_Macros
 For a typical clinical research project based on clinical and experimental data, some routine analyses are often essential to comprehend the data on hand and to draw valid conclusions. 
 However, generating reports in SAS® for routine analyses can be a time-consuming and tedious process, especially when dealing with large datasets with a massive number of variables in an 
 iterative and collaborative research environment. In this work, we present a series of SAS® macros that fits the daily needs of statistical programmer in pharma industry and clinical research. which covers a streamlined data analyses and produces journal-quality summary tables. The system is generic enough to fit a variety of research projects and enables researchers to build a highly organized and concise coding for quick updates as research evolves.
 The result reports promote communication in collaborations and will escort the research with ease and efficiency.
